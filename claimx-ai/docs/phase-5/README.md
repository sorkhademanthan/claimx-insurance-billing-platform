# Phase 5 — Event-Driven Microservices & Observability

Goal: Decouple using Kafka/Redpanda, add observability and monitoring.

Chapters:
- 5.1 Kafka topics and schema contracts
- 5.2 Async flows and event consumers/producers
- 5.3 Observability (OpenTelemetry, Prometheus/Grafana)

Checklist:
- [ ] Define event schemas and topics
- [ ] Producers & consumers + retries/backoff patterns
- [ ] Trace context propagation and logging
